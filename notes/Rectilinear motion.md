- instantaneous velocity is velocity in a short time period
- if acceleration is uniform: average velocity is (u + v)/2
- v = u + at, s = (u + v)t/2, s = ut + 1/2at^2, v^2 = u^2 +2as are equations of motion, the 3rd and 4th are provided
- when an object falls it's vertical displacement at time(s) is the same no matter it's horizontal trajectory
